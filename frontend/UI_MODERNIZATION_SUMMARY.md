## Design Principles Applied

1. **Modern Minimalism**: Clean, clear, professional design
2. **Tech Aesthetics**: Gradients, neon accents, dark theme
3. **Educational Friendly**: Intuitive, easy to understand, guided
4. **High Performance**: Smooth animations, responsive layout

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid system with breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- Flexible layouts that adapt to screen sizes
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44x44px)

## Accessibility
- Proper focus states with purple outline
- ARIA labels and roles
- Semantic HTML structure
- Good color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support

## Animation Strategy
- CSS-based animations for performance (transform, opacity)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms duration)
- Hover effects for interactive elements
- Loading states with spinning indicators
- Gradient shifts for visual interest

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Backdrop-filter for glass effects (fallback gracefully)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Custom scrollbar styling (Webkit browsers)

## Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Build completed without errors
✅ All components render correctly
⚠️  Pre-existing linting warnings in visualization components (not related to this task)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
