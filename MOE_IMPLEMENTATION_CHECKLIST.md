- [x] Highlight selected experts with glow effect
- [x] Serial routing animation

#### Step 7: Expert Internal Computation

- [x] ReLU activation visualization
- [x] Second layer: Linear (d_ff → n_embd)
- [x] Show sample token computation
- [x] Display intermediate vectors
- [x] Progressive animation

#### Step 8: Output Weighting & Merging
- [x] Multiply expert outputs by gate weights
- [x] Visualize weighted outputs
- [x] Element-wise addition animation
- [x] Show final MoE output matrix
- [x] Display formula/explanation

#### Step 9: Residual Connection
- [x] Show original input alongside
- [x] Element-wise addition
- [x] Display final output
- [x] Clear visual connection

#### Step 10: Load Balancing Statistics
- [x] Bar chart of expert usage counts
- [x] X-axis: Expert numbers
- [x] Y-axis: Selection frequency
- [x] Color-code by utilization (red for underused)
- [x] Display actual count values
- [x] Real-time update
